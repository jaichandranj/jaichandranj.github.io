<br><p align="left"><h4>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:

Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.
Avoid touching your face.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Stay home if you feel unwell.
Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.
Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.</h4>

<p><br><h3>How can we protect others and ourself if dont know who is infected?</h3><br>
<h4>Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!<h4></p>
<br><p><h3>All about masks in the context of COVID-19</h3></p>
<p>Masks&nbsp;should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.</p>
<p>If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work.&nbsp;<strong>Do it all!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or </strong><strong>disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
